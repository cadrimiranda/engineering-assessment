## Engineering Assessment

I have created a small map app to display some markdowns and map the food services with STATUS = "APPROVED" in the database. I didn't handle duplications, and I assumed your current location to be San Francisco downtown (although I've never been there). The app displays a list at the bottom, where you can search for a place name or food, and clicking on an item will redirect you to it.

- Initially, I thought of creating an autocomplete feature in the header. However, I found it to be less user-friendly as it only provided the place name. So, I changed it to an input field in the bottom list, which includes more details.
- I also considered creating a backend Node.js app to serve the data. However, it seemed unnecessary as the frontend could handle the data well.
- I wish I had more time to add tests. I would have liked to showcase my testing skills, but it can be done later in the process.
- The poor UI makes me uncomfortable to share it, but improving the user experience would require more time than expected for this task.
